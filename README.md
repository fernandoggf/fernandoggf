- 🧬 Hi, I’m @fernandoggf, a Biotech Engineer, Electronics Designer, and sometimes Developer (C and Python mostly),
- ⚙️ I’m interested mainly in bioinformatics, data-driven solutions such as Data Scientist projects, and low-level programming of microprocessors,
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics with Python ~ pandas and scrapping,
- 🔧 I’m currently working on a telecommunications network project based on UWB for positioning,
- 🪐 I consider myself an amateur in the code world but I love to spend hours writing code and making it work!
